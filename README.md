# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is my first coding project for boot camp and I built it to begin learning the skills for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. As I continue to learn more about these topics, I will add new information to this webpage so myself, and others, can truly use this guide to learn more about coding and/or refresh their knowledge.
